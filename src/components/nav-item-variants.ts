/**
 * NavItem style variants (cva). Formalizes the sidebar-row pattern:
 * rows whose corners follow the app-wide Style (`--ui-radius-control`:
 * rounded squares or pills, UiShapeProvider), `level` picks top-level vs. nested sizing, `active`
 * carries the current-page state (bg-primary top / secondary-container sub).
 * Note: the active top-level row deliberately switches to the label font
 * (font-label-sm) — that is the app's established look, kept 1:1.
 *
 * `collapsed` is the icon-only form a `Sidebar` puts its rows into. It hides
 * every **element** child that is not an `<svg>` and centers what is left, so
 * the row keeps its own `px-4`/`py-3` (and therefore its hit target and its
 * pill shape) at the narrower column width. Two consequences worth knowing:
 *  - the rule is written as a child selector on the row itself, so it works
 *    identically when `asChild` renders a router `<a>` — the class lands on
 *    the `<a>`, and the `<a>`'s children are what gets hidden;
 *  - it cannot hide a bare **text node** (`<NavItem>Team</NavItem>`), because
 *    CSS has no selector for one. That is why `NavItem`'s `label` prop also
 *    sets `aria-label`: the accessible name is then guaranteed regardless, and
 *    the visual contract ("put the row's text in an element") is stated on the
 *    prop.
