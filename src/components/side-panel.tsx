/**
 * Collapsible pane frame: width, collapsed state and border edge for a
 * workspace side pane (history on the left, sources on the right, …).
 *
 * **Controlled only.** `isOpen` and `width` are consumer state — a workspace
 * usually keeps both in a context and persists them, and two panes plus a
 * template have to agree on them. The frame keeps no open/width state of its
 * own, so there is one source of truth.
 *
 * **The collapse/expand control belongs to the frame, not to `children`:** it
 * is the only control that exists while the pane is collapsed. Passing it in
 * as content would make it disappear exactly when it is needed.
 *
 * **The toggle row can carry a `header`, and the toggle sits on the edge that
 * faces the content.** A left pane reads `[header … toggle]`, a right pane
 * `[toggle … header]` — mirrored, so both panes put their control next to the
 * main column rather than against the window edge, and so the two headers plus
 * the main column's bar line up as one `h-16` chrome row. `header` is
 * expanded-only; `footer` is **not** — it is pinned under the body when
 * expanded and moves into the rail when collapsed, because it is typically the
 * only route to sign-out and a control that vanished on collapse would strand
 * the user (0.30.0; it replaces the shell pinning its own footer inside
 * `children`).
 *
 * **The pane publishes its collapsed state** on `SidebarCollapsedContext`, so
 * `NavItem` and `SidebarUserMenu` hung into `children`/`footer` shrink to their
 * icon form in the rail without being told twice. Before 0.30.0 only `Sidebar`
 * provided it, which is why a nav column moved onto this frame rendered
 * full-width labels inside a 60px rail.
 *
 * While collapsed the pane shrinks to a `SIDE_PANEL_RAIL_WIDTH` rail showing
 * the expand button, the optional `collapsedPreview` and — since 0.30.0 — the
 * `footer`. **The rail is the expanded column's vertical mirror** (0.35.0): the
 * same `h-16` chrome row for the toggle, then the slot, then the pinned footer
 * — so nothing jumps to a different height when the pane collapses. `children`
 * stay mounted but hidden (attribute `hidden` + `display:none`), so scroll
 * position and half-typed input survive a collapse. All labels are props — a consumer
 * may be bilingual; this follows `navLabel` on `AppShellLayout` rather than
 * inventing a second pattern. The `<aside>` is a `complementary` landmark: with
 * more than one pane on screen, pass an `aria-label` so they can be told apart.
 *
 * Viewport behaviour is **not** here. Deciding whether a pane is shown at all
 * on a narrow screen — typically one pane at a time plus a `BottomTabBar` —
 * belongs to the composing template (`WorkspaceLayout`, and since 0.30.0
 * `AppShell`, which share `useIsDesktop` in `lib/pane-layout.ts`), so the same
 * frame works in every one of those places.

                  32px one there would also sit on different centres.

                  `layout-only-classname` flags a positive padding on a control
                  as a shrink-to-fit hack, and normally it is right. Here the
                  32px IS the specified geometry (developer decision,
                  21.09.2026): the toggle has to land on the same vertical line
                  as a 32px control in a `p-4` body, and no label can stop
                  fitting — the button's only child is a fixed 20px icon and
                  its accessible name is the `aria-label`. It stays a
                  `className` rather than a new `size` variant because the same
                  4px would then have to be right for every icon button in the
                  library, which is not this card's decision to make.
                  TODO: if a second call site wants 32px, promote this to a

            change when a taller or shorter `header` node is passed. (The
            collapsed RAIL keeps its 60px width — that is
            `SIDE_PANEL_RAIL_WIDTH`, a different measurement; see the TODO in
            `side-panel-variants.ts`.)

            A pane body is padded by its consumer (`AppShellLayout`'s nav uses
            `p-4`), so a 32px control at the trailing edge of the body's first
            row has its centre 16 + 16 = 32px from the pane edge. With
            `px-gutter` (24px) and the `icon` variant's 36px button the toggle
            sat at 24 + 18 = 42px, i.e. 10px off that line — visible on
            JustRAG's KB screen, where the pane's first body row carries such a
            control. `px-4` + the toggle's `p-1.5` put both centres on 32px.
            `Sidebar`'s header row (`sidebar.tsx`) already used `px-4`, so the
            two column headers now agree as well. Measured in Chromium by
            `SidePanel` → `ToggleAlignsWithBodyControl`, whose expectation is
            read off the body control's own rect.
