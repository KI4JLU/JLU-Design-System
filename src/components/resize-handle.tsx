/**
 * Accessible drag handle for resizing a neighbouring pane (`SidePanel`).
 *
 * **Ownership — decided, do not split:** the handle owns the *interaction*,
 * the consumer owns the *value*. Every pointer move and every key press is
 * clamped here and reported through the single `onValueChange` callback, so
 * the consumer stores one number and nothing else; the transient "is being
 * dragged" flag stays internal (it is interaction state, like `:hover`, not
 * data). `onResizeStart` / `onResizeEnd` are *notifications* — use them to
 * suspend an expensive re-layout while dragging, never to run a second drag
 * loop. A consumer-side pointermove listener plus this one is the failure mode
 * this component exists to remove.
 *
 * **`side` is the side of the pane being resized**, and it flips the key
 * direction: a left pane's edge is on its right, so ArrowRight/dragging right
 * makes it wider; a right pane's edge is on its left, so ArrowLeft/dragging
 * right makes it *narrower*. That is the splitter semantics: a key moves the
 * *separator*, and `aria-valuenow` reports the *pane's* size, so the same key
 * raises the value on one side and lowers it on the other. Home/End are
 * side-independent — they are the advertised minimum resp. maximum *value*
 * (`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax`), not a direction.
 *
 * `aria-valuenow` is always inside `[min, max]`: both input paths clamp.
 *
 * **Role — decided (owner, 2026-08): `separator`**, the WAI-ARIA APG "Window
 * Splitter" pattern, which is the pattern for exactly this widget; a focusable
 * separator keeps `tabIndex` and `aria-valuemin`/`-valuemax`/`-valuenow`.
 * `aria-orientation="vertical"` **stays**, and under `separator` it is finally
 * coherent: the attribute describes the orientation of the separator *itself* —
 * a vertical bar between two horizontally adjacent panes — and its default for
 * this role is `horizontal`, so it has to be stated explicitly. Under the
 * previous `slider` role the same attribute named the axis the *value* moves
 * along, which is horizontal here; that mismatch was the original defect.
 *
 * **`controls` — decided (owner card KI-597): the id of the pane root**, i.e.
 * the element whose width `aria-valuenow` reports (in a workspace that is
 * `SidePanel`'s `<aside>`, the named `complementary` landmark carrying the
 * inline width — not the inner body region its collapse toggle points at:
 * the toggle controls that region's *visibility*, this handle controls the
 * pane's *size*, and the two references stay distinct). Rendered as
 * `aria-controls`, which the APG splitter requires on the separator. The prop
 * is optional so a standalone handle stays usable, but without it the widget
 * is not fully APG-conformant — composed in `WorkspaceLayout` it is always
 * set. With `controls`, the pattern is complete: role, focusability,
 * `aria-valuemin`/`-max`/`-now`, label, stated orientation, the required
 * directional arrow keys, plus optional Home/End; of the pattern's optional
 * keys only Enter (collapse — `SidePanel`'s visible button owns that) and F6
 * (pane cycling — app chrome) are deliberately not implemented.
