/**
 * The collapsed state a nav column publishes to its own subtree. In its own
 * module so neither `sidebar.tsx` nor `side-panel.tsx` exports anything but a
 * component (react-refresh's "only export components" rule — same reason the
 * `*-variants.ts` files exist).
 *
 * `SidebarSurfaceContext` used to live here too. It told a `Sidebar` whether it
 * was the desktop column or `AppShell`'s second copy inside the mobile drawer.
 * The drawer is gone (0.30.0) — below `lg` the shell shows one area at a time
 * plus a `BottomTabBar`, so no node is mounted twice and nothing produced the
 * value any more. Deleted rather than left declared and unread.

/**
 * Whether the surrounding nav column is currently rendering its collapsed,
 * icon-width form.
 *
 * Provided by **both** column frames: `Sidebar` (its 80px icon column) and,
 * since 0.30.0, `SidePanel` (its 60px rail) — which is what `AppShell`'s nav
 * column is now. A single provider was the bug: moving the shell onto
 * `SidePanel` left the context at its `false` default, so `NavItem` and
 * `SidebarUserMenu` rendered their full-width form inside a 60px rail.
 *
 * Consumed by `NavItem` and `SidebarUserMenu`, and exported for consumers who
 * hang their own node into the `header`/`footer` slots and need to shrink it
 * the same way. Defaults to `false`, so every component reading it behaves
 * exactly as before when used outside either frame.
