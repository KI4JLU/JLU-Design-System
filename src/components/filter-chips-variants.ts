/**
 * Chip style variants (cva), in their own module so `filter-chips.tsx` exports
 * only components (react-refresh's "only export components" rule — the same
 * reason every other `*-variants.ts` here exists).
 *
 * TWO SHAPES, ONE ROW. A `filter` chip carries a label and is selectable; an
 * `action` chip is the trailing icon-only control (the "+"), which is square by
 * construction so the circle reads as a circle rather than a squashed pill.
 * They share the height, the border and the focus ring so the row is one strip
 * of controls and not two.
 *
 * WHY THE ACTIVE STATE IS A TINTED FILL AND NOT A SOLID ONE. A solid `bg-primary`
 * chip has the visual weight of a primary BUTTON, and next to four of them the
 * row would read as five calls to action rather than as one selected filter.
 * `bg-primary/10` + `text-primary` + a primary border is the same treatment
 * `Button`'s ghost variant already uses for `aria-pressed=true`, so a selected
 * chip and a pressed ghost button look like the same idea — which they are.
