 * | content … footer      | <main> scrolls on its own   | content … footer  |
 * ```
 *
 * **Both side columns are `SidePanel`** (0.30.0) — the same frame
 * `WorkspaceLayout` composes, with its own toggle, its own rail and its
 * `h-16` header row, which is why the two column headers and `topBar` land on
 * one baseline. The collapsed form **is** the 60px rail; a shell that wants
 * icons in it passes `collapsedPreview`. `Sidebar` is no longer what this
 * frame renders — it stays exported for a standalone nav column.
 *
 * **Both columns are drag-resizable since 0.36.0** — opt-in, through
 * `AppShellPanel.resize`. Given, the shell composes `SidePanel` +
 * `ResizeHandle` per column, which is what `WorkspaceLayout` has always done;
 * the shell had the panes but not the handles, so an app on `AppShellLayout`
 * could not widen its nav column at all (JustRAG's KB screen, KI-94). Omitted,
 * nothing changes: no separator, no id on the `<aside>`, the 256px default.
 * The width itself stays the consumer's number — this package stores nothing.
 *
 * **Below `lg`: one area at a time plus a `BottomTabBar`**, the arrangement
 * `WorkspaceLayout` already implements, chosen in JS (`useIsDesktop`) for the
 * reason given there: a shown area is not a narrower version of itself — it
 * fills the screen, ignores the collapse state and must lose its collapse
 * control. The consumer declares which tab shows which area (`mobileTabs`) and
 * which tab is current; it writes no breakpoint check.
 *
 * **No drawer, no dialog, and therefore no focus management.** Until 0.29.0
 * the narrow-screen navigation was a Radix `Dialog`, which brought a focus
 * trap, Escape-to-close and a scroll lock *because it was an overlay*: content
 * behind a modal must not be reachable, and a modal needs a way out. The
 * tab-bar arrangement is not an overlay — the shown area **is** the page,
 * nothing is layered over anything, so there is no "behind" to trap focus away
 * from and no dismissal to bind Escape to. Removing the dialog removes all
 * three requirements rather than leaving them unimplemented; what stays is the
 * tab bar's own contract (a `navigation` landmark, exactly one
 * `aria-current="page"`).
 *
 * **Every node is mounted once.** The drawer rendered the *same* nav node a
 * second time, so a consumer's `id` inside it existed twice while the drawer
 * was open (JustRAG hit exactly this and documented it in `AppChrome.tsx`).
 * With the drawer gone there is one mount per node in every state — which is
 * also why `SidebarSurfaceContext`, the mechanism that told the two copies
 * apart, is deleted.
 *
 * **One `<main>` per arrangement, never two** — and when a side column is the
 * area on screen below `lg`, there is no `main` landmark at all: the main
 * column is not in the tree, and wrapping a `complementary` in `main` would be
 * a worse lie than its absence. Same rule, same consequence as
 * `WorkspaceLayout` — which since 0.37.0 **is** this component: it renders an
 * `AppShell` without a `topBar`, mapping its `WorkspacePane`s onto
 * `AppShellPanel`s. `mainLabel` and `showRight` are the two props that made
 * that mapping lossless; there is one frame in this library, not two.
 * TODO: that a narrow screen showing a side column has no `main` landmark is a
 * consequence, not a confirmed decision with the design-system owner.
 *
 * TODO: below `lg` a shown column renders its `content` and its `footer` but
 * **not** its `header` — the header row exists to carry the collapse toggle
 * (which must be gone there) and the brand (which `topBar` already shows),
 * while the footer is typically the only route to sign-out. Reasoned from
 * those two facts, not confirmed with the design-system owner.
 *
 * **The collapsed rail keeps the footer** (0.30.0): `SidePanel` renders it
 * below the rail's scrolling strip, and publishes its collapsed state on
 * `SidebarCollapsedContext`, so a `SidebarUserMenu` there shrinks to its
 * avatar. Without both halves a collapsed column had no route to sign-out and
 * rendered full-width nav labels in 60px.
