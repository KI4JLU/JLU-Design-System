/**
 * Single-select filter strip: a row of pill chips above a list, exactly one of
 * them active, with an optional trailing action chip for adding a new one.
 *
 * The shape is the one a messenger's chat filter uses — „Alle · Favoriten ·
 * <category> · +" — and it is for the case `SegmentedControl` and `FilterMenu`
 * both get wrong:
 *   - `SegmentedControl` is a JOINED row inside one rounded border. It reads as
 *     one control with segments, which suits a fixed axis (Tag/Woche/Monat) and
 *     not an open-ended list the user extends at runtime;
 *   - `FilterMenu` hides the options behind a dropdown, so the available
 *     filters are invisible until opened — the opposite of what this strip is
 *     for, where seeing the categories IS the point.
 *
 * **Controlled, and exactly one chip is active.** `value` always names a chip;
 * there is deliberately no „nothing selected" state, because the first option
 * is „Alle" — an unfiltered list is a selection, not the absence of one. A
 * `value` matching no option renders every chip inactive rather than throwing,
 * which is the readable failure when a stored filter outlives the category it
 * named.
 *
 * **ARIA: a group of toggle buttons, not a tablist and not a radiogroup.**
 *   - not `tablist`: tabs switch PANELS and owe the reader arrow-key roving
 *     focus. These chips filter one list in place; there is no second panel;
 *   - not `radiogroup`: APG's radio pattern also requires roving focus and
 *     Home/End, which would make Tab skip past the whole strip — wrong for a
 *     row whose chips are individually reachable controls;
 *   - so `role="group"` + `aria-pressed` per chip, which is exactly what
 *     `SegmentedControl` in this library already does for the same "one of
 *     these is on" shape. One convention, not two.
 * Name the group: pass `aria-label` saying what is being filtered.
 *
 * The strip SCROLLS horizontally rather than wrapping (`overflow-x-auto` +
 * `shrink-0` chips). Wrapping would change the height of the chrome above a
 * list as categories are added, which moves the list under the reader's cursor;
 * scrolling keeps the row one line tall whatever it holds.
