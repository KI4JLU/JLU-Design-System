 * a confirmation because it carries information the user still has to act on,
 * while a success toast only confirms what they just did. `neutral` uses
 * Radix's own default (5000).
 *
 * These are *defaults*, not a limit: `duration` on a single `Toast` overrides

 * with a 4px accent edge on the left in the variant's status color.
 *
 * Layout is a three-column grid — icon · content · close — with **zero column
 * gap**: the spacing lives on the icon's `mr-3` and the close button's `ml-3`
 * instead. A CSS grid gap is applied between tracks even when a track is
 * empty, so a `gap-x-3` here would indent the text by 12px on every toast that
 * has no icon. Row placement is left to auto-placement (`col-start-2` on
 * title/description/action stacks them), which keeps the parts order-independent
 * at the call site.
