/**
 * Template „Sectioned Grid": a page whose content is a **stack of

 * category (grouped collections a user enters from here). Optional
 * `PageHeader` on top, then one section per group: header row (title,
 * optional icon, optional count, optional action) plus a body that is either
 * a `Grid` of cells, an empty-state line, or a free-form node.
 *
 * Composes `Container` + `PageHeader` + `Grid` + `Badge`. It is page
 * **content**: hang it into `AppShellLayout` as `children`, exactly like
 * `DashboardLayout` — the branded header, the page label, the theme toggle
 * and the user menu belong to the shell, not here.
 *
 * **Composition only.** No data fetching, no derivation, no state of its own
 * — not even „which section is open". Grouping, sorting and the
 * owned-vs-shared split stay in the app; the sections arrive as given.
 *
 * **Responsive behaviour is pure CSS, and there is no `matchMedia` here.**
 * The card grid's collapse is `Grid`'s (`cols` is the desktop count), the
 * title row stacks in `PageHeader`, and the section header row wraps. Nothing
 * in this template renders a structurally different tree per viewport, so it
 * needs no viewport awareness at all — unlike `WorkspaceLayout`, whose
 * arrangement genuinely changes.
 *
 * **The disclosure, and why it is not an `Accordion`.** The design system has
 * no `Accordion` primitive and this template does not smuggle one in: each
 * section is an ARIA **disclosure** (APG) built from a button and a panel.
 * The button carries `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`; it sits *inside* the
 * `<h2>` so the heading stays navigable (APG's accordion markup). The panel
 * element is **always** rendered — an `aria-controls` pointing at an id that
 * exists only while open would be a dangling reference that announces
 * nothing — and carries `hidden` while collapsed; its *children* are
 * unmounted. That mount behaviour is deliberate and load-bearing: in the
 * source implementation (`KbAccordion`) the discovery panel's fetch hangs off
 * mount, so expanding the section is what re-reads the catalog. It is also
 * the opposite of `SidePanel`, which keeps children mounted so a half-typed
 * input survives a collapse — a card grid has nothing to lose, a form does.
 *
 * The panel gets **no** `role="region"`: a disclosure needs none, and APG
 * warns against landmark proliferation past ~6 panels. This template
 * contributes exactly one landmark, its own `<section aria-label>`.
 *
 * TODO: two API points are reasoned above but **not yet confirmed** with the
 * design-system owner — (a) the name (`SectionedGridLayout` over `IndexLayout`
 * / `HomeLayout`, argued on the card) and (b) that collapsing unmounts the
 * body rather than only hiding it, which a consumer with expensive section
 * content may want to opt out of.
